## Introduction

Gene expression analysis is a fundamental process in molecular biology, providing insights into how genes are expressed and regulated under different biological conditions. This repository showcases a comprehensive workflow, starting from sequence data processing to uncovering gene structures and correlations through unsupervised machine learning techniques.

## Data Structure and Algorithms for Sequencing

In the directory, you will find Python scripts that demonstrate:

- Reading and manipulating sequence data using Biopython.
- Implementing hash mapping to analyse sequence data efficiently.
- Applying dynamic programming algorithms for sequence alignment.
- Breaking down sequences, using hash mapping, and performing dynamic programming to align sequences.

Refer to the README file in the directory for detailed instructions on running the code.

## DESeq2 for Differential Expression Analysis

In the directory, you will also find Python scripts that guide you through the following:

- Quantifying gene expression from BAM files generated by alignment tools like HISAT2.
- Utilizing the DESeq2 package for normalisation, statistical analysis, and identification of differentially expressed genes.
- Understanding the concepts of fold change, p-values, and multiple testing correction.

## Unsupervised Machine Learning

In the directory (coming soon), you'll discover code that demonstrates:

- Using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction of gene expression data.
- Applying feature selection and data normalisation techniques to preprocess the data.
- Performing hierarchical clustering to reveal underlying gene structures and correlations.
- Employing K-means analysis to identify gene subgroups with shared characteristics.
